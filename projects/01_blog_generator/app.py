- Vary your sentence length. Some short. Others longer, with a clause that earns its place.
- Use contractions (it's, don't, you'll) and talk straight to the reader as "you".
- Replace vague claims with a concrete example, a number, or a small story.
- Having an opinion is fine. Saying "I" is fine.
- Never use these words and phrases: "in today's fast-paced world", "delve", "moreover",
  "furthermore", "unlock", "leverage", "robust", "seamless", "game-changer",
  "it's worth noting", "navigate the landscape", "at the end of the day".
- Do not start every section the same way.
- Only use a bullet list when the content really is a list. Prefer paragraphs.
- Do not end with a summary of what you just said. End with one useful thought."""
